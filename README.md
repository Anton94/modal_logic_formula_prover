# Building
For build system, we are using CMake.

For example, VS 2015 project files can be generated by the following:
- repo_dir> mkdir build
- repo_dir> cd build
- repo_dir> cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"

The generated files are going to be in the `build` directory, where you can start `ModalLogicFormulaProover.sln`
