[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Anton94/modal_logic_formula_prover.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Anton94/modal_logic_formula_prover)

# modal_logic_formula_prover
TODO: Master degree project for prooving/disprooving formulas (space and probability)

# Dependencies:
- [cpprestsdk](https://github.com/microsoft/cpprestsdk) for the web client
- CMake
- Cpp14
- npm
- Boost 1.6

# Building
For build system, we are using CMake.

For example, if using vcpkg to install the cpprestsdk/boost, a VS 2015 project can be generated by the following:
- repo_dir> mkdir build
- repo_dir> cd build
- repo_dir> cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg_repo>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"

The generated files are going to be in the `build` directory, where you can start `ModalLogicFormulaProover.sln`

# Sanitizers
We are using [google's sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers) via CMake.
Note that for memory sanitizer you will need e.g. llvm-symbolizer to see the sources & lines and not just the addresses.


# JS Tests
In the client project run:
- npm install -g jasmine
- jasmine
