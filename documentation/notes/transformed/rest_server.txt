Rest Server

The Web server is used to serve:
	- Rest APIs 
	- Resources

The Rest APIs are used to check for satisfiability, to find connectivity models or meassured models.
The Resources are:
	- html pages, 
	- images 
	- Javascript code.

The Web Interface is easy to use, contains only the needed information and from there 
can be executed all of the described satisfiability algorithms.

One client can execute only one algorithmic program at a time. 
This way it is ensured that there are not a lot of simultaneous executing programs by the server.

If the program execution time gets too long the client has the possibility to terminate the execution 
of the current program by server. This will re-enable the client to execute another program and will remove 
the execution load from the server.

If the client posts a couple formula for calculation and terminetes the session (for example closes the browser),
then the task in the backend will be terminated as well.

The output of the program is separated in three modules:
	Resulting output - indicates what was the final result of the execution.
		For example: The formula is satisfiable.

	Verbose output - This is the output which contains the full proof of the formula execution.
		This output is printed though the whole execution.

	Visualized graph - This is the end result of the model, if such model exists
		The visualization is done with a JavaScript third party library for drawing graphs.
