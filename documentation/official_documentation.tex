	\newpage
	\section{Formula Representation}
	Few paragraphs about the modal logic and basic story of how and what we are trying to accomplish	
	\subsection*{Def: Variable}
		A sequence of characters and numbers compose a variable.
	\newline
	\newline
	Example variables:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item x0
		\item x1
		\item foo
		\item obj111
	\end{itemize} 
	\subsection*{Def: Index Variable Function} 
		Let ivf: $\mathbb{V} \longmapsto \mathbb{N}$ be a bijective function which maps a variable to an index integer number. This function is used to map a variable into a 
		computer memory, since integers are easily stored and manipulated.
	\subsection*{Def: Optimal Variables indexes set}
		Let S be a set of unique variables with size k, then there exists a variable index function ivf such that:
		\begin{equation}
			\forall i < k \: \exists v \in S: ivf(v) = i.
		\end{equation}

		\subsubsection*{Proof}
			Arrange the variables from S in a sequence $x_0, x_1, ... x_k$, then take the index of the variable to be 
			the value of the index variable function for that variable, namely:
			\begin{equation}
				\forall i < k \: : ivf(x_i) = i.
			\end{equation}
	\subsection*{Def: Bitset}
		A sequence of zeros and ones compose a bitset.

		If the sequence has size k, then it will be called k-bitset.
		\newline
		\newline
		Let x be a bitset, namely $x = a_0, a_1, ...$, then the i-th element of the bitset x is $a_i$. 
		To get the i-th element the following notation will be used:
		\begin{equation}
			x[i]
		\end{equation}
		which returns the $a_i$ element.

		\subsubsection*{Operations over bitsets}
			Let x and y be two k-bitsets, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then: 
			\newline
			\newline
			bitset-AND operation is defined as:
			\begin{equation}
				a \& b = a[0] \& b[0], a[1] \& b[1], .. , a[k] \& b[k]
			\end{equation}
			where the truth table for two basic variables x and y is:
			\newline
			\begin{tabular}{cc|c}
				x & y & x \& y \\
				\hline
				0 & 0 & 0 \\
				0 & 1 & 0 \\
				1 & 0 & 0 \\
				1 & 1 & 1 \\
			\end{tabular} 
			\newline
			bitset-OR operation is defined as:
			\begin{equation}
				a | b = a[0] | b[0], a[1] | b[1], .. , a[k] | b[k]
			\end{equation}
			where the truth table for two basic variables x and y is:
			\newline
			\begin{tabular}{cc|c}
				x & y & x | y \\
				\hline
				0 & 0 & 0 \\
				0 & 1 & 1 \\
				1 & 0 & 1 \\
				1 & 1 & 1 \\
			\end{tabular} 
			\newline
			bitset-OR operation is defined as:
			\begin{equation}
				a \| b = \bar{a[0]}, .. , \bar{a[k]}
			\end{equation}
			where the truth table for basic variable x is:
			\newline
			\begin{tabular}{c|c}
				x & $\bar{x}$ \\
				\hline
				0  & 1 \\
				1 & 0 \\
			\end{tabular} 
			\newline
			bitset-PlusOne
			Deoted a + 1 represents the next bitset after a, which is constructed as follows:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item if $\forall i < k: a[i] \neq 0$, then there are no more k-bitsets, meaning that
					the next bitset has size k+1 and has only one one at position zero and all others are zeroes.
				\item Otherwise let i be the index of the last zero position, then the next bitset is constructed as:
					\begin{equation}
						a[0]^0, ..., a[i-1]^{i-1}, 1^i, 0^{i+1}, ...., 0^k
					\end{equation}
					The upper right index denotes the position in the bitset sequence.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection*{Def: Variable bitset substitution}
			Let $\mathbb{U}$ be a set of bitsets, then the Variable bitset substitution is a total mapping 
			 $\rho : \mathbb{V} \longmapsto \mathbb{Ba}$ and the following notation will be used:
			\begin{equation}
				x \longmapsto b
			\end{equation}
			where x is a variable and b is a bitset.
		\subsection*{Special types of bitsets}
			Let x be a k-bitset, then x is called
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the world, if $\forall i<k : x[i] = 1$, denoted with 1
				\item the empty k-bitset, if $\forall i<k : x[i] = 0$, denoted with 0
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection*{Term recursive definition}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 1 is a term
			\item 0 is a term
			\item $p \in \mathbb{V}ar$ is a term
			\item If x is a term, then $\bar{x}$ is a term as well
			\item If x and y are terms, then $x \sigma y $ is a term as well,\\
				where $\sigma \: \in \: \{\sqcap, \sqcup\}$
		\end{itemize}	

		\subsection*{Term Implementation Representation}
			The term can be represented in memory recursively by analogy to the definition REF-DEF-TERM.

		\begin{lstlisting}
class Term 
{
	...

	operation_t op_;
	std::size_t hash_;
	
	struct childs
	{
		term* left;
		term* right;
	}
	union 
	{
		childs childs_;
		std::size_t variable_id_;
	}

	...
}
		\end{lstlisting}
		The term is represented in a tree structural way, where each node is an operation and the leafs of the tree
		are variables. In the above implementation the variables are represented by their index, which can be 
		easily found with the Index Variable Function.

		\subsection*{Term Set-Evaluation}
			Let X be a set of variable Set-Substituitions, namely $ X = \{ x_0 \longmapsto b_0, x_1 \longmapsto b_1, ..., x_k \longmapsto b_k \}$,
			then the Term Set-Evaluation is a function which produces a bitset for a given term by appling a set of substitutions.
			The Term Set-Evaluation is applicable if and only if all variables from the term have a suitable substitution in X.
			\newline
			\newline
			The Term Set-Evaluation will be notated as termSEval is defined recursively as follows:
			\newline
			Let $\tau$ be a term, then:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item if $\tau \equiv 1$, then \\
					return the world bitset
				\item if $\tau \equiv 0$, then \\
					return the empty bitset
				\item $\text{Let } v \in X \text{ and } \tau \equiv v$, then \\
					return X[v]
				\item $\text{Let } \tau_1, \tau_2 \text{ be two terms } \text{ and } \tau \equiv \tau_1 \sqcap \tau_2$, then \\
					return $termSEval(\tau_1) \& termSEval(\tau_2)$
				\item $\text{Let } \tau_1, \tau_2 \text{ be two terms } \text{ and } \tau \equiv \tau_1 \sqcup \tau_2$, then \\
					return $termSEval(\tau_1) | termSEval(\tau_2)$
			\end{itemize}

	\section{Formula Representation1}
	Let $\mathbb{V}ar$ be the set of variables:
	\[ \mathbb{V}ar = \{p_0, p_1, p_2 ... \}\]
	Let $\mathbb{C}_t$ be the set of Term constants:
	\[ \mathbb{C}_t = \{0, 1 \}\]
	\subsection{Term recursive definition}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $a \in \mathbb{C}_t$ is a term
		\item $p \in \mathbb{V}ar$ is a term
		\item If x is a term, then $\bar{x}$ is a term as well
		\item If x and y are terms, then $x \sigma y $ is a term as well,\\
			where $\sigma \: \in \: \{\sqcap, \sqcup\}$
	\end{itemize}
	Parentheses are used to define the priority of an operation.
	\newline
	Let $\mathbb{C}_f$ be the set of formula constants:
	\[ \mathbb{C}_f = \{T, F \}\]
	\subsection{Formula recursive definition}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $a \in \mathbb{C}_f$ is a formula
		\item If x and y are terms, then C(x, y) is a formula
		\item If x and y are terms, then $x \le y$ is a formula
		\item If x and y are terms, then $x \le_m y$ is a formula
		\item If $\varphi$ is a formula, then $\neg \varphi$ is a formula as well
		\item If $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are formulas, then $\varphi \: \sigma \: \psi $ is a formula as well,\\
			where $\sigma \in \{\vee, \wedge, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow\}$
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection*{Formula Parentheses}
		Parentheses are used to define the priority of an operation. They are defined for terms and formulae.
	
	\subsection{Definition: Atomic Formula}
		A formula will be called atomic formula if it is one of the followings:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item T
			\item F
			\item C(x, y)
			\item $x \le y$
			\item $x \le_m y$
		\end{itemize}
		where x and y are terms.
	
	\subsection{Definition/Theorem: Zero Term Formula}
		Let x and y be two terms, then:
		\begin{equation}
			x \le y  \iff x \sqcap \bar{y} = 0
		\end{equation}
		A formula in the form $x \sqcap \bar{y} = 0$ will be called Zero Term Formula.


	\subsection{Parser}
		Flex and Bison are used to generate a parser with the modal logic grammar.
		Flex is used as a tokenizer while Bison is used as the parser.
		\newline
		There are two types of building elements in the modal logic formula:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item terms, defined in \#REF Term Recursive Definition
			\item formulae, defined in \#REF Formula Recursive Definition
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsubsection{Symbols Representation}
		\subsubsection*{Atomic terms}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 0 is the term constant False
			\item 1 is the term constant True
			\item Arbitrary string is used to represent a variable
		\end{itemize}
		
		\subsubsection*{Terms operations}
		Let t1, t2 be terms, then the followings are the representations for term operations
		\begin{itemize}
			\item - t1 is used to represent the complement term operation, namely $\bar{t1}$
			\item t1 * t2 is used to represent the intersection term operation, namely $t1 \: \sqcap \: t2$
			\item t1 + t2 is used to represent the union term operation, namely $t1 \: \sqcup \: t2$
		\end{itemize}
		
		\subsubsection*{Atomic formulae}
		Let t1, t2 be terms, then the followings are representation of atomic formulae
		\begin{itemize}
			\item T is the formula constant True
			\item F is the formula constant False
			\item C(t1, t2) is the contact operation
			\item <=(t1, t2) is the less or equal operation
			\item <=m(t1, t2) is the measured less or equal operation
			\item (t1)=0 is the equal to zero operation
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Tokenizer}
	\subsubsection*{Grammar}
		The tokenizer's grammar is pretty simple and is explaned in details in the following table with Flex syntaxes:
		% Matched token |  token
		\begin{flushleft}
			\begin{tabular}{ | m{7em} | m{15em}| m{10em} | } 
				\hline
					Matched token & Formatted token & Description \\ [0.7ex] 
				\hline
					[ \textbackslash t \textbackslash  n] & ; & Returns nothing, ignore all whitespace \\ 
				\hline
					[,TF01()C\&|~*+-] 	& yytext[0]; & yytext[0] is the matched character. All single charecter tokens will be passed as their ASCIIs for an easier use in Bison \\
				\hline
				    "<="            &   T\_LESS\_EQ; & Returns a special literal which maps the '<=' sequence \\
				\hline
				    "<=m"           &   T\_MEASURED\_LESS\_EQ; & \\
				\hline
				    "=0"            &   T\_EQ\_ZERO; & \\
				\hline
				    "= 0"           &   T\_EQ\_ZERO; & \\
				\hline
				    "->"            &   T\_FORMULA\_OP\_IMPLICATION; & \\
				\hline
				    "<->"           &   T\_FORMULA\_OP\_EQUALITY; & \\
				\hline
				    [a-zA-Z0-9]+    &   T\_STRING; & Returns T\_STRING literal type and the string  value is written to yylval which can be later accessed from the parser. Note that it uses our simple memory manager to allocate this string in order to be able to safely free all allocated strings even when some syntax error occures \\
				\hline
				    .               &   yytext[0]; & bison will trigger an error if it's unrecognized symbol \\
				\hline

			\end{tabular}
		\end{flushleft}

		\subsubsection*{Parser literals}
			One character tokens are passed as their ASCII to Bison.
			The followings are definition of literals for multi character tokens
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \%token <const char*> T\_STRING is the literal for "string"
				\item \%token T\_LESS\_EQ is the literal for "<="
				\item \%token T\_MEASURED\_LESS\_EQ is the literal for "<=m"
				\item \%token T\_EQ\_ZERO is the literal for "=0"
				\item \%token T\_FORMULA\_OP\_IMPLICATION is the literal for "->"
				\item \%token T\_FORMULA\_OP\_EQUALITY is the literal for "<->"
			\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection*{Parser literals}
			The followings are definitions of priority and associativity of the operation tokens. 
			The priority is from low to hight (w.r.t. the line order in which they are defined)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \%left T\_FORMULA\_OP\_IMPLICATION T\_FORMULA\_OP\_EQUALITY
				\item \%left '|' '+'
				\item \%left '\&' '*'
				\item \%right '\textasciitilde' '-'
				\item \%nonassoc '(' ')'
			\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection*{Parser grammar}
			In the process of parsing the formula the Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) is built as well, 
			which later is used to make formula modifications, for example converting X -> Y to \textasciitilde X | Y .
			\newline
			create\_formula\_node and create\_term\_node are two helper functions which construct AST nodes
			% go into details here about the create_formula_node and term_node

		\subsubsection*{Abstract Syntax Tree}
			The visitor pattern is used to modify the formula, namely it's AST tree.
			\newline
			The visitor pattern uses double virtual dispatching.

			\subsubsection*{Operation types in the formula/term nodes}
				\begin{lstlisting}

};
				\end{lstlisting}

				The visitor pattern gives us the ability to add new visitors in a very simple manner.
				The new visitor should override the two visit methods and do whatever it wants with the ast nodes.
				\newline
				%intro on why are we doing all those modifications to the formula's AST

			\subsubsection*{Visitors Implementation}
				\subsubsection*{VReduceConstants}
					Removes all unnecessary childs of And/Or/Negation operations of the following type:

					\begin{table}[H]
					  \centering
					  \begin{tabular}{llll}
					    \toprule
					    \midrule
					\tabitem \textasciitilde T $\equiv$ F & \tabitem C(0,0)  $\equiv$ F & \tabitem \textasciitilde F $\equiv$ T & \tabitem C(1,1) $\equiv$ T \\
					\tabitem (T \& T) $\equiv$ T & \tabitem C(a,0)  $\equiv$ F & \tabitem (F | F) $\equiv$ F & \tabitem C(0,a) $\equiv$ F \\
					\tabitem (g \& T) $\equiv$ g & \tabitem -1 $\equiv$ 0 & \tabitem (g | T) $\equiv$ T & \tabitem -0 $\equiv$ 1 \\
					\tabitem (T \& g) $\equiv$ g & \tabitem (1 * 1) $\equiv$ 1 & \tabitem (T | g) $\equiv$ T & \tabitem (0 + 0) $\equiv$ 0 \\
					\tabitem (g \& F) $\equiv$ F & \tabitem (t * 1) $\equiv$ t & \tabitem (g | F) $\equiv$ g & \tabitem (t + 1) $\equiv$ 1 \\

					\tabitem <=(0,a) $\equiv$ T & \tabitem (0 * t) $\equiv$ 0 & \tabitem <=(a,1) $\equiv$ T & \tabitem (0 + t) $\equiv$ t \\

					    \bottomrule
					  \end{tabular}
					\end{table}
				\subsubsection*{VConvertContactsWithConstantTerms}
					Converts contacts with constant 1 terms in !=0 atomic formulas. 
					This visitor is best used after the contacts are reduced, via VReduceConstants
					\begin{itemize}
						\item C(a,1) $\equiv$ ~(a=0)  
						\item C(1,a) $\equiv$ ~(a=0)
					\end{itemize}
				\subsubsection*{VConvertLessEqContactWithEqualTerms}
					Converts contacts and <= atomic formulas with same terms:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item <=(a,a) $\equiv$ T, \\
							since (a * -a = 0))
						\item C(a,a) $\equiv$ ~(a=0)
					\end{itemize}
				\subsubsection*{VReduceDoubleNegation}
					Removes the double/tripple/etc negations. 
					This visitor is best used after all visitors which might add additional negations!
					\begin{itemize}
						\item --g $\equiv$ g
						\item --t $\equiv$ t
					\end{itemize}
				\subsubsection*{VConvertImplicationEqualityToConjDisj}
					Converts all formula nodes of type implication and equality to nodes 
					which are using just conjuction and disjunction. 
					Main reason for that is to simplify the tableau method - 
					to work only with conjunctions and disjunctions.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item (f -> g)  $\equiv$ (~f | g)
						\item (f <-> g) $\equiv$ ((f \& g) | (~f \& ~g))
					\end{itemize}
				\subsubsection*{VConvertLessEqToEqZero}
					Converts the less equal atomic formula to an equals to zero atomic formula
					\begin{itemize}
						\item <=(a,b) $\equiv$ (a * -b) = 0
					\end{itemize}
				\subsubsection*{VSplitDisjInLessEqAndContacts}
					Converts the less equal atomic formula to an equals to zero atomic formula
					\begin{itemize}
						\item C(a + b, c) $\equiv$ C(a,c) | C(b,c)
						\item <=(a + b, c) $\equiv$ <=(a,c) \& <=(b,c)
					\end{itemize}

				There are few visitors which only collect or print information from the formula
					\begin{itemize}
						\item VVariablesGetter - gets all variables from the formula (as string)
						\item VPrinter - prints the formula to some provided output stream
					\end{itemize}
	
	\newpage
	\section{Formula Structure}
		The formula structure is similar to the AST structure, but with restricted formula operations and additional information.
		% intro that the formula is built recursively 
		There are 2 types of nodes: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item formula
				\item term
			\end{itemize}
		Every member variable in the nodes is caluclated dulring its building,
		this way getting the hash code of a node is done in a constant time.

		\subsection*{Formula Node Structure}
		\begin{lstlisting}
class formula
{
public:

	\subsection{Building a formula node}  % Add more information on how the formula is built.
		The building of the formula structure is trivial, namely based on the AST node's operation types.
		Few important specifications of a node 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item hash code
			\item variable mask for all used variables in the term(and it's child terms)
		\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection*{Node's hash code}
			The hash code of a node is mainly used to compare if two nodes are equal. 
			This comparison is used in all maps and sets where the key is a node. 
			
			If for two formulas/terms nodes, their hash codes are same, then the content of the nodes is 
			compared in order to verify that they are the same formulas/terms.
			\newline
			The contact operatior requires a special check since the commutativity of Contacts is supported.
			\newline
			% for this we should have an additional definition.

			Let a, b be two terms, then
			\begin{equation}
				C(a, b) = C(b, a)
			\end{equation}
			therefore the check for equality will be done twice instead of once, namely
			\begin{equation}
				 C(a, b) = C(c, d) \rightarrow (a = c \wedge b = d) \vee (a = d \wedge b = c).
			\end{equation}
		

		TODO Explain item variable mask for all used variables in the term(and it's child terms)

		\subsubsection{Formula Refiners}
			The formula refiners are an optional parameter when building a formula node.
			They are a set of optional filters which may optimize the formula by reducing redundant parts of the 
			formula or by transforming some nodes in a way that they will be easier to be evaluated later on.
			
			Most important formula refiners:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Convert Contacts and less or equal atomic formas which have same terms
				\item Convert disjunction in contacts and less or equal atomic formulas
				\item Reduce constants
				\item Reduce contacts with constants
				\item Remove double negation
			\end{itemize}

			These formula refiners are done when the formula is built, meaning that after the 
			AST tree is constructed each of these refiners enables or disabled a visitor. 
			The formula refiners are mapped in a one to one manner to a subset of all the visitors defined 
			in \#REF visitor.

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Convert Contacts and less or equal atomic formula which have same terms \\
					 is mapped to VConvertLessEqContactWithEqualTerms
				\item Convert disjunction in contacts and less or equal atomic formulas \\
					 is mapped to VSplitDisjInLessEqAndContacts
				\item Reduce constants \\
					 is mapped to VReduceConstants
				\item Reduce contacts with constants \\
					 is mapped to VConvertContactsWithConstantTerms
				\item Remove double negation \\
					 is mapped to VReduceDoubleNegation
			\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection*{Node evaluation}
		TODO: this should be explained very well, and not just here but with multilpe definitions on theory level
		

	\section{Tableaux}
	The Tableaux process is decision procedure, which recursively breaks down a given formula into basic components 
	based on which a decision can be concluded. The recursive step which breaks down a formula creates one or two 
	new formulas, which in terms of their structure are simpler then the initial formula. Since the recursive step can create
	at most two new formulas, this means the recursive step will create at most two branches or a binary tree, where the nodes
	are the formulas and the links represent the recursive step. The different branches are considered to be disjuncted while
   	nodes of the same branch are considered in conjunction. The procedure modifies the tableau in such a way that the 
	formula represented by the resulting tableau is equivalent to the original one.

	Contradiction may arise when in the same branch, on some step there exists a formula and the negation of the same formula.
	If in some branch there exists a contradiction, then that branch closes. If all branches close then the proof is complete.
	
	The main principle of the tableaux is to break complex formulae into smaller ones until complementary pairs of literals are
	produced or no further expansion is possible.

	\subsection{Definition: Tableaux Step}

		\subsubsection*{Definition: Signed Formula} 
			Let $\varphi$ be a formula, then:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $\mathbb{T}\varphi$ signs $\varphi$ as true
				\item $\mathbb{F}\varphi$ signs $\varphi$ as false
			\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection*{Definition: Signed Formulae set}
			The signed formulae set consists only of signed formulae and the letter X will be usually used for its representation.

		The Tableaux Step takes as input a formula and a signed formulae set and produces as 
		output one or two new formulae, depending on the operation.
		The signed formulae set consists of the broken down formulae by previous tableaux steps.
		The output of the tableaux step depends on the rule applied to the formula.

		\newline
		\newline
		\newline
		The final output of the Tableaux process is "False" when all branches are closed or a set of atomic formulae, when there exists a branch which is not closed.
		\newline
	
		For our usecases the functionality of the tableaux process shall be extended to achive better results, since if the branch is not closed, there are 
		additional calculations needed in order to verify that there is no contradiction, namely to verify that there is no contradiction on Term level which means 
		that there exists a satisfiable model.
		This verification can be done in different manners, depending on the algorithm type. The best way to think about it is that the tableaux process returns a 
		not-closed branch and if there is a model for the set of atomic formuas in this branch, then the formula is satisfiable, otherwise the tableaux process proceeds 
		with the next not-closed branch. If such branch does not exist then the formula is not satisfiable. 

	\subsection{Tableaux implementation}
		The programming implementation of the tableaux method follows the standard tableaux process explaned above.

		First interesting design decision is to keep all true signed formulae in one data set, and all false signed formulae in another data set.
		This enables fast searches wheter a formula has been signed as true or false.
		
		\subsubsection*{Definition: Signed Formula Collection}
			Let X be a set of formulae, then X is called signed formula collection if and only if all formulae in X are signed as true 
			or all formulae are signed as false.

			This collection is implemented with unordered\_map (hashmap),
			which stores the formulae by pointers to them, uses their precalculated hash and operator== to compare them.
			The average complexity for search, insert and erase in this collection is O(1).
		\newline
		\newline
		There exist 8 important signed formula collections:
%Note add definition for positive and negative collections !!!
		\begin{itemize}
			\item formulas\_T - contains only non-atomic formulae signed as true
			\item formulas\_F - contains only non-atomic formulae signed as false, \\
				For example, if $\neg\varphi$ is encountered as an output of the tableaux step, then only $\varphi$ is inserted into the formula\_F
			\item contacts\_T - contains only contacts formulae signed as true
			\item contacts\_F - contains only contacts formulae signed as false
			\item zero\_terms\_T - contains only formulae of type $\varphi \le \psi$ signed as true
			\item zero\_terms\_F - contains only formulae of type $\varphi \le \psi$ signed as false
			\item measured\_less\_eq\_T - contains only formulae of type $\varphi \le_m \psi$ signed as true
			\item measured\_less\_eq\_F - contains only formulae of type $\varphi \le_m \psi$ signed as false
		\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection*{Definition: Formula Contradiction}
			Let $\varphi$ be a signed formula, then $\varphi$ is causing a contradiction if any of the followings is true:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $\varphi$ is a non-atomic signed as true and $\varphi \in$ formulas\_F
				\item $\varphi$ is a non-atomic signed as false and $\varphi \in$ formulas\_T
				\item $\varphi$ is a contact formula signed as true and $\varphi \in$ contacts\_F
				\item $\varphi$ is a contact formula signed as false and $\varphi \in$ contacts\_T
				\item $\varphi$ is a zero terms formula signed as true and $\varphi \in$ zero\_terms\_F
				\item $\varphi$ is a zero terms formula signed as false and $\varphi \in$ zero\_terms\_T
				\item $\varphi$ is a measured less formula signed as true and $\varphi \in$ measured\_less\_eq\_F
				\item $\varphi$ is a measured less formula signed as false and $\varphi \in$ measured\_less\_eq\_T

			\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection*{Invariant}
			At any time, all formulae in all eight signed formula collections do not contradict.

			A contradiction may occure if a formula is split and some of the resulting components causes a contradiction.

		\subsubsection*{Example}
			Let's assume that contacts\_T = \{ C(a, b)\} and let's have a look at the following formula $\mathbb{T}(T \wedge \neg C(a,b))$.
			\newline
			By the rules of decomposition, namely the ( $\wedge$ ) rule produces $\mathbb{T}T \text{ and } \mathbb{T}\neg C(a,b)$. 

			Then the $\mathbb{T}\neg C(a,b)$ will be decomposed to $\mathbb{F} C(a,b)$ by the ( $\neg$ ) rule, which causes a contradiction
			since C(a,b) is already present in contacts\_T formulae

		\subsubsection*{Tableaux Algorithm}
			Given a formula $\varphi$, the following algorithm determines the atomic formulae in all branches of the tableaux process.

			As a first step if the formula $\varphi$ is the constant F, then false is returned directly, otherwise the whole formula $\varphi$ is inserted in formulas\_T.
		\newline
			\subsubsection*{Remarks}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item true boolean value is used to represent the formula constant T
				\item false boolean value is used to represent the formula constant F
				\item Contact atomic formula is commutativity, meaning that: C(a,b) == C(b,a)
			\end{itemize}
			Few lemmas which will provide a much more efficient contradiction finding in the tableaux process.
			\subsubsection*{Lemma: A}
				Let x be a term, suppose that the atomic formula x = 0 has already been signed as true,
				then marking the following formulae as true will lead to contradiction:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item C(x,y)
					\item C(y,x)
				\end{itemize}
				for some arbitrary term y.

			\subsubsection*{Lemma: A-inverse}
				Let x, y and z be terms, suppose that the atomic formulae C(x,y) or C(z, x) has already been signed as true,
				then marking the formula x = 0 as true will lead to contradiction.
				\newline
				TODO: addd short proof.
			\subsubsection*{Time Complexity A and A-inverse} 
				The algorithmic complexity to check whether a new formula leads to contradiction by Lemma A and Lemma A-inverse is done
				effectively, namely in constant time with the usage of one new collection contact\_T\_terms\_ which keeps the terms of 
				the true contacts, namely the contacts in in the collection contacts\_T. This means that for each $\mathbb{T}(C(x, y))$, the 
				terms x and y are in the mentioned collection of true terms. The contact\_T\_terms\_  is a multiset and keeps track 
				of all added terms, meaning that if the term x is added twice and then removed only once there will still be an entry of 
				that x in the contact\_T\_terms\_ collection.
				
				To check if a new formula leads to contradiction by Lemma A or Lemma A-inverse the following method is used:
				\begin{lstlisting}
auto has_broken_contact_rule(const formula* f) const -> bool;
				\end{lstlisting}

			\subsubsection{Handy methods}
			\subsubsection*{Find formula}
			\subsubsection*{Find formula signed as true}

				if $\varphi$ is of type:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item C(x, y), then return true $\iff \varphi \in contacts\_T$
					\item $x \le y$, then return true $\iff \varphi \in zero_terms\_T$
					\item $x \le_m y$, then return true $\iff \varphi \in measured_less_eq\_T$
					\item $\neg \psi$, then return true $\iff \varphi \in formulas\_T$
					\item $\psi_1 \sigma \psi_2$, where $\sigma \in \{\wedge, \vee\}$, then return true $\iff \varphi \in formulas\_T$

			\subsubsection{Def: Tableaux branch output}
			\label{tableaux:branch:output}
				As stated above the ouput of a branch in the tableaux process is a set of atomic formulas.
				These atomic formulas can be grouped in six groups:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Contacts
					\item Non Contacts
					\item Equal to Zero Terms
					\item Not Equal to Zero Terms
					\item Meassured Equal to Zero Terms
					\item Meassured Not Equal to Zero Terms
				\end{itemize}
				These four groups can be represented with the following formula:
				\begin{align*}
					\bigwedge\nolimits_{i} \; C(a_i, b_i) \:\: \wedge \:\: &
					\bigwedge\nolimits_{j} \; \neg C(e_j, f_j) \:\: \wedge \:\: \\
					\bigwedge\nolimits_{k} \; d_k = 0 \:\: \wedge \:\: &
					\bigwedge\nolimits_{l} \; g_l \neq 0 \:\: \wedge \:\: \\
					\bigwedge\nolimits_{s} \; <=_m(H_s, O_s) \:\: \wedge \:\: &
					\bigwedge\nolimits_{u} \; \neg (<=_m(Q_u, R_u) )
				\end{align*}

	\section{Formula Model}
		% What is a model ? 
		Every model type has at least two things in common:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Adjacency matrix for the contacts between the points
			\item Vector of bitsets representing the value of v(p), namely the set of points which are in v(p)
		\end{itemize}

		All models also have similar collection of points each of which has an evaluation for all 
		used variables in the tableau's path (this evaluation identifies the point).
		\newline
		All models can be created(or at least tried to be created) via the signed formula collections and 
		some meta information for the whole formula, via the 'create' method.
		\begin{lstlisting}
virtual auto create(const formulas_t& contacts_T, 
	const formulas_t& contacts_F, 
	const terms_t& zero_terms_T,
	const terms_t& zero_terms_F, 
	const formulas_t& measured_less_eq_T, 
	const formulas_t& measured_less_eq_F, 
	const variables_mask_t& used_variables, 
	const formula_mgr* mgr)
    -> bool = 0;
		\end{lstlisting}

		\subsubsection*{Adjacency Matrix member variable}
			\begin{lstlisting}
/*
    Symetric square bit matrix. contacts_[i] gives a bit mask
    of all points which are in contact with the point 'i'.
    For example, let us have a model with 6 points:
        0---1  // contact between 0 and 1
        2---3  // contact between 2 and 3
        4      // point from !=0 term
        5      // point from !=0 term

    The bit matrix will be the following:
        \ 012345
        0 110000    // from 0---1 and reflexivity (0---0)
        1 110000    // from 1---0 and reflexivity (1---1)
        2 001100    // from 2---3 and reflexivity (2---2)
        3 001100    // from 3---2 and reflexivity (3---3)
        4 000010    // just reflexivity (4---4)
        5 000001    // just reflexivity (5---5)
*/
contacts_t contact_relations_;
			\end{lstlisting}

		\subsubsection*{Variable Evaluations member variable}
			\begin{lstlisting}
/*
    A vector of size the number of variables in the formula, 
    each element is a set of points, represented as a bitset.
    Keeps the variable evaluations, i.e. v(p).

    Model evaluation 'v' which for a given term returns 
    a subset of the model points.
    :
     - v(p) = { i | (i) (xxx...x)[p] == 1, i.e. in point 'i' 
        the evaluation of the variable 'p' is 1 }, where 'p'
        is a variable(for optimzations it's an id of the 
        string representation of that variable)
     - v(a * b) = v(a) & v(b)
     - v(a + b) = v(a) | v(b)
     - v(-a) = ~v(a)

    For example, let us have the following 
        formula: C(a * b, c) & c != 0 & -a != 0
    Then a model could be the following:
        (110) (a * b) 0---1 (c) (001)
        (011) (c)  2
        (000) (-a) 3
    Let assume that 'a' has a variable id 0, 
        'b' has id 1 and 'c' has id 2.
    The bit matrix will be the following:
        \ 0123     // variable ids (rows) \ model points (columns)
        0 1000     // v(a) = { 0 }, i.e. all points 
             which have evaluation with bit at positon 0 set to 1
        1 1010     // v(b) = { 0, 2 }, ... at position 1 ...
        2 0110     // v(c) = { 1, 2 }, ... at position 2 ...

	\subsection{Connected Model}
		NOTE Intro on what the connected model really is !
		ADD Connectivity lemma.
		Let us have $\varphi$ in the format defined in the definition of \hyperref[tableaux:branch:output]{the tableaux branch output}. % for now this is formula 4 
		Let us define few constants which will ease the annotation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item N - number of variables in the atomic formulas
			\item M - number of atomic formulas
			\item I - number of Contact atomic formulae
			\item J - number of Non Contact atomic formulae
			\item K - number of Not Equal to Zero atomic formulae
			\item L - number of Equal to Zero atomic formulae
		\end{itemize}
		1) Let $\mathbb{M}$ denote the model of all possible unique model points, where one model point corresponds to 
			one variable evaluation $P_i$. 
			\newline
			Since there are N variables, the number of unique model points is $2^N$.
			\newline

			1.1) Filter out the model points which interfere with the zero terms, 
			which means that if $P_i$ evaluates some term $G_l$ to constant true then $P_i$ is filtered out.
			\newline

			1.2) Filter out the model points which interfere with the Non contants, which mens that 
				If $P_i$ evaluates some terms $E_j$ and $F_j$ to true, then $P_i$ is filtered out.
			\newline

			NOTE: that if $P_i$ evaluates the term $\tau$ to constant true then the model 
			evaluation v($\tau$) contains the point $P_i$ (and vice versa).
			\newline
			\newline
		So far, the model $\mathbb{M}$ satisfies all Equal to Zero atomic formulas and 
		the reflexivity property of the Non Contacts.
		\newline TODO: explain reflexivity of contacts in the theoretical part.
			\newline
			\newline		
		2) Verification is done for the Not Equal to Zero atomic formulas in $\mathbb{M}$, namely:
			\begin{equation}
				\text{If  } \exists k: v(D_k) \neq \emptyset \text{ , then there does not exist a connected model.}
			\end{equation}

		2.1) Verification is done for the Contact atomic formulas in $\mathbb{M}$, namely:
			\begin{equation}
				\text{If  } \exists i: v(A_i) = \emptyset \vee v(B_i) = \emptyset \text{, then there does not exist a connected model.}
			\end{equation}
			\newline
		So far, $O(2^N * N)$ bits of memory to hold all points and 
		their evaluations and $O(2^N * M)$ time to process them.
			\newline
			\newline	
		3) Let $\mathbb{C}$ be a bit matrix of size $2^N x 2^N$.
			\newline
			
			This matrix will be called connectivity matrix and will represent the connected points in $\mathbb{M}$.
			
			\begin{equation}
				\text{Model points i and j are in contanct if } \mathbb{C}[ i ][ j ] \text{ is set.}
			\end{equation}

			Initialy all points are in contact, which means that the initial value of each bit is set:
			\begin{equation}
				\text{Let } \forall i, j < 2^N : \mathbb{C}[ i ][ j ] = 1
			\end{equation}
	
			3.1) Remove all connections which interfere with Non Contact atomic formulas.
				\begin{align*}
					\forall a, b < 2^N, \forall j < J :& \\
						\text{if } P_a [E_j] = 1 \wedge P_b [F_j] = 1 &\vee P_a[F_j] = 1 \wedge P_b[E_j] = 1, \\
						\text{then unset } \mathbb{C}[a][b] &\text{ and } \mathbb{C}[b][a].
				\end{align*} 
				
			Note that the reflexivity has been satisfied in 1).
			\newline

			For this step $O(2^N * 2^N) = O(2^{2*N})$ bits of memory were used and 

			total of $O(2^N * 2^N * J)$ time complexity.
			\newline
			\newline	
		4) Check that all Contacts are still satisfied
			\begin{equation}
				\forall i, j < 2^N: C(A_i, B_i) \text{ is satisfied}
			\end{equation}
			
			The check whether $C(A_i, B_i)$ is satisfied is done in the following maner:
			
			\begin{equation}
				\forall p \in v(A_i): (\mathbb{C}[p] \text{  bit\&  } v(B_i)) \neq 0
			\end{equation}
			Where $\mathbb{C}[p]$ is a bitset representing all contacts of p and 
			$v(B_i)$ is a bitset representing the evaluation of $B_i$.
			\newline
			Thus $(\mathbb{C}[p] \text{  bit\&  } v(B_i)) \neq 0$ means that there is 
			a common point between the evaluation of $B_i$ and the contacts of p.
			\newline
			\newline
			The complexity for this step is: $O(I * (H + L * G)$,where: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item H is the complexity for evaluation some term, 
					it's at most the number of operations in the term, something small.
				\item L is the number of points in $v(A_i)$ which is at most $2^N$.
			       \item G is the complexity for "bit operator \&" which is $2^N/2^6$.
			\end{itemize}
		5) The previous step produces the maximal unique satisfiable model, wihch is a graph $\mathbb{G}$.
			If there exists a satisfiable connected subgraph in the $\mathbb{G}$, then this is the connected model.
			Finding all connected subgraphs has time complexity of $O(2^N + 2^N * 2^N)$.
			Checking if a subset of points satisfies the formula can be done in a similar fashion(as the one above).
			\newline
			Note that only the check for Not Equal to Zero and Contacts atomic formulas has to be done, 
			since when a point is removed the  Equal to Zero and Non Contacts atomic formulas can not be broken.
			\newline
			Let Y be the number of points in the subset, then at most $O(Y * Y * M)$ time complexity.
			Note that this must be done for ach connected subgraph and the subgraphs are not overlapping!
			Upper bound for Y is $2^N$, so the upper bound and on the time complexity is: 
			\begin{equation*}
				O(2^N * 2^N * M),
			\end{equation*}
			since 
			\begin{equation*}
				x * x * M + y * y * M <<< (x+y)*(x+y)*M
			\end{equation*}
			\newline
			\newline	
		Overall memory complexity: $O(2^N * 2^N)$ bits
		\newline
		Overall time complexity: $O(2^N * 2^N * M)$

	\subsection{System of Inequalities}
		The systems are of the following type:	
		\[
			\syslineskipcoeff{1.50}
			\systeme*{\sum_{i^1} X_{i^1} <= \sum_{j^1} X_{j^1},
				\:\:.\:\:.\:\:.,
				\sum_{i^n} X_{i^n} <= \sum_{j^n} X_{j^n}, 
				\sum_{k^1} X_{k^1} > \sum_{l^1} X_{l^1},
				\:\:.\:\:.\:\:.,
				\sum_{k^m} X_{k^m} > \sum_{l^m} X_{l^m}
				}
		\]
	
		To calculate these systems of inequalities a third party library is used, which is specialized 
		to solve systems of inequalities. The library's name is Kiwi.
		\newline
		\subsection{System Construction}
		The system of inequalities is constructed from the potential meassured model by evaluating each
		of the terms in the Meassured less or equals and Meassured greater atomic formulas. The points in the model are 
		enumerated from 0 to N - 1, where N is the number of model points. The system will have N different variables $X_0, X_1, ..., X_n$, 
		where $\forall i < N: X_i \text{ is mapped to point i}$
		\newline
		TODO: Add beter theoretical explanation
		\newline
		\newline
		1) For each <=m(x, y) calculate v(x) and v(y), then an inequality of the following type is created: 
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{i \in v(x)} X_i <= \sum_{j \in v(y)} X_j
		\end{align*}

		If some X is on both sides of an inequality, then both of them are removed.
		\newline
		2) For each \textasciitilde<=m(x,y) calculate v(x) and v(y), then an inequality of the following type is created: 
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{i \in v(x)} X_i > \sum_{j \in v(y)} X_j
		\end{align*}

		If some X is on both sides of an inequality, then both of them are removed.
		\newline

		3) For each variable in the model a new greater than constraint is added to the system
		\newline
		If the system of inequalities constructed in this maner has solution, then this system of inequalities
		satisfies the meassured model.

		\subsection{Meassured Less Operator Representation}
		All of the researched third party libraries for solving systems of inequalities work only with Less or Equal inequalities.
		This means that the greater inequalites must be simulated with the usage of Less or Equal inequalities.
		\newline
		This absence is solved with the addition of a really small variable while converting the greater inequality to 
		less or equal inequality.
		\newline
		Let us have the following inequality
		\[
			\syslineskipcoeff{1.50}
			\systeme*{\sum_{i^1} X_{i^1} > \sum_{j^1} X_{j^1}}
		\]
		then this inequality is transformed into:
		\[
			\syslineskipcoeff{1.50}
			\systeme*{0 <= \sum_{i^1} X_{i^1} - \sum_{j^1} X_{j^1}} + \epsilon
		\]
		where $\epsilon$ is a small value.
		\newline
		The inequality X > 0, which is a variable to be greater than zero is transformed into:
		\[
			\syslineskipcoeff{1.50}
			\systeme*{0 <= X - \epsilon} 
		\]
		\newline
		Google's linear solver Glop (OR-Tools) was one of the tested libraries and it has precision around $1*10^{-7}$.
		Kiwi's precision is around $1*10^{-8}$. 
		\newline
		These results are based on simple empirical testing, namely:

		A simple system of only one inequality $X > 0$ which is converted to $X - \epsilon >= 0$. 
		While testing the $\epsilon$ value was slowly decreasing and when it gets smaller than $1*10^{-7}$
		($1*10^{-6}$ for google's Glop (OR-Tools) ) the solver gave a wrong answer.
		\newline
		\newline
		Besides this anomaly, the precision is good enough for the purposes of finding solutions for the special type
		of systems of inequalities defined above.

	\subsection{Measured Model}
		% NOTE Intro on what the measured model really is !
		Let us have $\varphi$ in the format defined in the definition of \hyperref[tableaux:branch:output]{the tableaux branch output}. % for now this is formula 4 
		Let us define few constants which will ease the annotation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item N - number of variables in the atomic formulas
			\item M - number of atomic formulas
			\item I - number of Contact atomic formulae
			\item J - number of Non Contact atomic formulae
			\item K - number of Not Equal to Zero atomic formulae
			\item L - number of Equal to Zero atomic formulae
			\item S - number of Measured Not Equal to Zero atomic formulae
			\item U - number of Measured Equal to Zero atomic formulae
		\end{itemize}
		
		\subsubsection*{Points construction}
		The Measured Model is composed of modal points, the number of modal points is $I + L + S + U$.
		
		The following atomic formulas produce an existance of a modal point:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $C(A_i, B_i)$ produces two modal points, \\
				where x and y are terms.
			\item $g_l \neq 0$ produces one modal point, \\
				where x is a term.
			\item $<=_m(H_s, O_s)$ produces one modal point
			\item $\neg (<=_m(Q_u, R_u) )$ produces one modal point
		\end{itemize}
		For each contact $C(A_i, B_i)$ two new model points are created A and B, where $A \in v(A_i) \text{ and } B \in v(B_i)$.
		In some cases the point created for a contact might be one, but this in turn is simulated by having the same evaluation for two 
		points, which means that the point is duplicated.
		\newline
		Each Point will be represented with $P(\tau , e)$, where $\tau$ is a term and e is the variable evaluation.
		The point's evaluation P[e] positively evaluates the point's term $P[\tau ]$, meaning that P belongs to $v(P[\tau ])$.
		\newline
		Example: Let's have C(a + b, c*d)
		\newline
		then a valid model point for 'a + b' is P('a+b', [1000]), where [1000] is the evaluation for (a, b, c, d) variables.
		That evaluation evaluates 'a+b' to true.
		\newline
		For 'c*d' a point could be: P('c*d', [0011]).
		\newline
		All possible combinations of such points are $2^{N * (I + L + S + U)}$, since there are $I + L + S + U$ number of points and 
		each point has $2^N$ potential evaluations.
		\newline
		The following algorithm determins if there is a satisfiable measured model.

		\subsubsection*{Measured Model Algorithm}

			1)  For each $C(A_i, B_i)$ two points are created $P_a$ and $P_b$: $P_a[A_i] = true$ and $P_b[B_i] = true$.
				If not possible - then there is no satisfiable model.
			\newline
			\newline
			2) For each $g_l \neq 0$ one point is created P: $P[g_l] = true$.
				If not possible - then there is no satisfiable model.
			\newline
			\newline
			3) For each measured atomic formula a modal point is created which is associated to '1' constant term.
			\newline
			\newline
			4) A connection is made between the contact points, first 2*I points are from Contact terms,
				 i.e. for each 0 <= i < I a connection is added in the connectivity matrix between 2*i and 2*i + 1 points. % NOTE DEF CONNECTIVITY MATRIX
			\newline
			
			A new combination of points is generated by 9) until the steps from 5 to 8 are satisfied.
			\newline

			5) Calculate the v(X) for each variable. % (TODO: this should be explained somewhere else already)
			\newline

			6) For each $G_l \neq 0$ evaluate $v(G_l)$ and check that it is not the empty set. O(L)
			\newline

			7) For each \textasciitilde $C(E_j, F_j)$ check that $v(E_j)$ and $v(F_j)$ does not contain a common point and that $v(E_j)$ does not contain a point which is in contact with a point $v(F_j)$.
			\newline

			Complexity: O(J * (I + J) * G)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item G is the complexity for "bit operator \&" which is something like $(I+J)/2^6$.
				\item I+J is the number of points.
			\end{itemize}
			
			8) Check the measured atomics: \\% TODO: we should have already defined why we are doing it in some theoretical part of the documentation 

			For each $<=_m(H_s, O_s)$ calculate $v(H_s)$ and $v(O_s)$ and create an inequality of the following type: 
			\begin{align*}
				\sum_{i \in v(H_s)} X_i <= \sum_{j \in v(O_s)} X_j
			\end{align*}
			For each $\neg (<=_m(Q_u, R_u) )$ calculate $v(Q_u)$ and $v(R_u)$, create an inequality of the following type: 
			\begin{align*}
				\sum_{i \in v(Q_u)} X_i > \sum_{j \in v(R_u)} X_j
			\end{align*}
			Each inequality is a row in the system of inequalities. 
			If this system has a solution, then the generated model is a satisfiable one. \\ % say that the above def of system of in. is the solver
			
			Finish!
			\newline

			9) The generation of new combination of points: \\
				Similar to binary +1 operation but instead of just 0 and 1 states on each position there are $2^N$ combinations,
				from which some will not be valid because they will not evaluate the point's term to true
			\newline
			Here is an example of binary +1 operation:
			\begin{align*}
				000 + 1 &= 001 \\
				001 + 1 &= 010 \\
				010 + 1 &= 011 \\ 
				011 + 1 &= 100 \\
				100 + 1 &= 101 \\
				101 + 1 &= ...
			\end{align*}
			If there are two variables and two points and for the sake of simplicity ignore the term for now.
    			At first there will be only 0s. \\
			$[00][00]$ where the first [00] is the evaluation of the first point which evaluates both variables to 0.
			\newline
			The next generations looks as follows:
			\begin{align*}
				[00][00] -(&\text{next combination})-> [00][01] \\
				->& [00][10] \\
				->& [00][11] \\
				->& [01][00] \\
				->& [01][01] \\
				->& [01][11] \\
				->& [10][00] \\
				-..->& [11][11]
			\end{align*}
			In the above example the [11][11] is the last combination.
			\newline
    			When the condition that the point's evaluation should evaluate the term to true is taken into account, then all evaluation which do not evaluate the 
			term to true are skipped.
			\newline
    			Example: if the variables are 'x' and 'y', first point's term is 'x', second point's term is 'y' then the valid sequence of combinations will be:
			\begin{align*}
				[x:1 y:0, 'x']&[x:0 y:1, 'y'] -> [10][11]  \\
				->& [11][01] \\
				->& [11][11]
			\end{align*} % WHAT ? 
			\newline

			TODO: THIS complexity should be explained and recalculated:
			\newline
			Complexity: O((I + L + S + U) * G), where G is the complexity for finding a next evaluation for a point, 
			namely finding an evaluation which evaluates the point's term to true.
	\newpage
		\subsubsection*{Fast Model Algorithm}
			A model is simply a set of points and contacts between them which satisfies the Contacts and Less or equal atomic formulas.

			This model will be easirly explained with an example first:
			\subsubsection*{Example 1.1}
				Let $\varphi$ be the following formula:
				\begin{equation*}
					\varphi = C(a,b) \& C(c,d) \& C(e,f) \& g != 0 \& x = 0 \& ~C(y,z)
				\end{equation*}
				This formula is constructed from 3 contacts, one not equal to zero term, one equal to zero term 
				and one non contact atomic formula.
				\newline
				The model for this formula is constructed from seven modal points, namely two modal points for each
				contact and one point for the not equal to zero term.
				\newline
				HERE DRAW SOMEHOW THE MODAL
				\newline
				In the above graph the (xxx...x) is a bitset, for example (010...1) which gives zero/one evaluation
				for the variables in the formula. Its size is the number of different variables in the formula.
				The model points are the nodes in the graph ranging from 0 to 6. 
				Each node connected to its self, this way the reflexivity of the contacts is represented, and the 
				edges represent the contact relations.
				\newline
				One note can be made that in the above graph the Zero terms and Non Contact atomic formulas are 
				not represented since they do not require existance of model points.

				\subsubsection*{Definition Model Evaluation}
				Model evaluation v which for a given term returns a subset of the model points.
				The model evaluation v is defined as:
				\begin{equation*}
					v(p) = \{ i | (i) (xxx...x)[p] == 1 \} 
				\end{equation*}
				which means that for a given variable p, 
				v(p) returns a set of all points in which the variable p is evaluated to true.

				\subsubsection*{Properties}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item v(a * b) = v(a) \& v(b)
					\item v(a + b) = v(a) | v(b)
					\item v(-a) = ~v(a)
				\end{itemize}

				Note that each point's evaluation evaluates it's term to the constant true in order to that point to be
				in the MODEL evaluation of the term, i.e. for the point 0, 
				the term 'a' and it's evaluation (xxx..x): a->evaluate(xxx..x) = constant\_true 
				in order to 0 belongs to v(a)
				\newline
			
			\subsubsection*{Example 1.2}
				Let $\varphi$ be the following formula:
				\begin{equation*}
					\varphi = C(a,b) \& C(c,d) \& e=0 \& f=0 \& ~C(g,h) \& ~C(i, j)
				\end{equation*}
				Then the model should be of the following type:
				\newline
				DRAW THIS
				(P0 a)----(P1 b)
				(P2 c)----(P3 d)
				\newline
				NOTE that if Pi evaluates the term 't' to constant true then the model 
				evaluation v(t) contains the point (Pi \_) (and vice versa)
				\newline
				Where: \\
				P0 evaluates(binary) a to constant true \&\& e and f to constant false \\
			      P1 evaluates(binary) b to constant true \&\& e and f to constant false \\ 
				P2 evaluates(binary) c to constant true \&\& e and f to constant false \\ 
			      P3 evaluates(binary) d to constant true \&\& e and f to constant false \\ 
				Also, to satisfy the requirement for ~C: (we need to check each contact relation): \\
				~[(P0 evaluates g to constant true \&\& P1 evaluates h to constant true) || \\
				(P1 evaluates g to constant true \&\& P0 evaluates h to constant true)] \&\& \\
				~[(P0 evaluates i to constant true \&\& P1 evaluates j to constant true) || \\
				(P1 evaluates i to constant true \&\& P0 evaluates j to constant true)] \&\& ... analogous for P2 and P3. \\
				\newline
				The contact relation is reflexive, so for each point we also need to check also:	\\
				~(Pi evaluates g to constant true \&\& Pi evaluates h to constant true) \&\& \\
				~(Pi evaluates i to constant true \&\& Pi evaluates j to constant true)

			\subsubsection{Algorithm}
			% NOTE Intro on what the fast model really is !
			Let us have $\varphi$ in the format defined in the definition of \hyperref[tableaux:branch:output]{the tableaux branch output}. % for now this is formula 4 
			Let us define few constants which will ease the annotation:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item N - number of variables in the atomic formulas
				\item M - number of atomic formulas
				\item I - number of Contact atomic formulae
				\item J - number of Non Contact atomic formulae
				\item K - number of Not Equal to Zero atomic formulae
				\item L - number of Equal to Zero atomic formulae
			\end{itemize}
			
			Note: The term evaluation is with an accumulated complexity of O(L) which is not included in the O notation bellow.
			\newline
			\newline
			The algorithm which creates such points in an iterative manner is as follows:
			\newline
			1) Creates contact points, i.e. for each C(a,b) we create two points Pa and Pb.  \\
				Note that a point is just an variable evaluation. \\
				They satsfy the following rules: 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Pa[a]=1 and Pb[b]=1.
					\item does not break any t=0 atomic formula, \\
						i.e. Pa[t]=0 and Pb[t]=0.
					\item does not break the reflexivity part of all ~C(e,f) atomic formulas, \\
						i.e. Pa[e]=0 \& Pa[f]=0 \& Pb[e]=0 \& Pb[f]=0.
					\item does not break any ~C(e,f) atomic formulas, \\
						i.e. ~[(Pa[e]=1 \& Pb[f]=1) | (Pb[e]=1 \& Pa[f]=1)]
				\end{itemize}
				
				If any of the rules above is not satisfied we change Pb's evaluation, 
				if not possible to generate a new evaluation for Pb then we change 
				Pa's evaluation and reset the Pb's evaluatuion to the 'first' one.

				If again some rules is broken we change Pb's evaluation, etc. 
				if we can't generate new evaluation for Pa then there is no satisfiable model.
				\newline

				Complexity for this step: O(2\^N * 2\^N * (G+M))
				\newline
				\newline
				2) Creates a point for each a!=0 atomic formula - Pa, which satisfy the following rules:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Pa[a] = 1
					\item does not break any t=0 atomic formula, \\
						i.e. Pa[t]=0
					\item does not break the reflexivity part of all ~C(e,f) atomic formulas, \\
						i.e. Pa[e]=0 \& Pa[f]=0
				\end{itemize}

				If any of the rules above is not satsfied with Pa, 
				then we generate next Pa's evaluation and check them again. 
				If not possible to generate next evaluation then there is no satisfiable model.
				\newline

				Complexity for this step: $O(2^N * (G+M))$
				\newline
				\newline
				3) We create the contact connectivity matrix - 
				PxP in a simple way because we know that only first 2K points are in contact.
				0 <= i < K: set a contact relation between point i and i+1, 
				i.e. we set the bit [i][i+1] to 1 and [i+1][i] to 1.
				\newline

				Complexity for this step: $O(P^2)$
				\newline
				\newline
				5) We calculate the v(X) for each variable.
				We create a vector of N bitsets. 
				Each bitset will hold all points in the evaluation of that variable, 
				i.e. bitset at position 'j' is the set v(j), where 'j' is some variable id.
				\newline

				For each point Pi, we iterate over the set bits in it's evaluation and 
				if we have a set bit at position j we add that point to the evaluation 
				of varialbe 'j', i.e. we set the bit 'i' in the variable's evaluation bitset.
				\newline

				Complexity for this step: O(P * N)
				\newline
				\newline

				Overall Complexity: $O(2^N * 2^N * (G+M))$
					% (I suppose that 2^N >>> P)

	\section{Rest Server}
		The Web Server is used to serve:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Rest APIs
			\item Resources
		\end{itemize}
		The Rest APIs are used to chek for satisfiability, to find connected models or meassured models.
		\newline
		The resources are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Html pages
			\item Images 
			\item Javascript code
			\item Styles
		\end{itemize}
		The Web Interface is easy to use, contains only the needed information and from there 
		can be executed all of the described satisfiability algorithms.

		One client can execute only one algorithmic program at a time. 
		This way it is ensured that there are not a lot of simultaneous executing programs by the server.
		
		If the program execution time gets too long the client has the possibility to terminate the execution 
		of the current program by server. This will re-enable the client to execute another program and will remove 
		the execution load from the server.

		If the client posts a couple formula for calculation and terminetes the session (for example closes the browser),
		then the task in the backend will be terminated as well.

		\subsection*{Output}
		The output of the program is separated in three modules:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Resulting output - indicates what was the final result of the execution. \\
				For example: The formula is satisfiable.
			\item Verbose output - This is the output which contains the full proof of the formula execution. \\
				This output is printed though the whole execution.
			\item Visualized graph - This is the end result of the model, if such model exists \\
				The visualization is done with a JavaScript third party library for drawing graphs.
		\end{itemize}
